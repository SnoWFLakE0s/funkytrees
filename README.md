## Contribution Guidelines

### Naming Conventions

#### Verbosity
Directory names should be verbose (include the name of the topic in full, with no abbreviations). For examples, the pages on part variables include the full name of the part, like `helirotorsmall`. 

#### Capitalization
Directory names will be in full lower case, with no spaces or dashes.

### Hyperlinks
Please use relative links when adding hyperlinks within the documentation.
Dot notation works great for this, as it allows for context within your text editor & works as proper links when the site is compiled. Since this is a project site, proper relative links are necessary for the links to point to the correct directory.

For subdirectories:
```
./subdirectory/
```
For directories outside of the current directory:
```
../siblingpage/
```

You can combine these `../../` to get to any level of the website.
