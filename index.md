## About this webpage

The Funky Trees documentation is maintained primarily by Joshua "SnoWFLakE0s" Eah, and other community contributors who helped verify the content of the articles. You too can help us write better documentation, include more information to make the amazing features of Funky Trees more accessible to anyone in the SimplePlanes community.

You too can contribute by reporting bugs, incorrectly listed information, and information that would help everyone if it were listed in this documentation. Thank you for being here, and we hope you have a nice stay.
