# Functions
#### Technical reference for the built-in functional library of the Funky Trees expression language.

Functions are predefined operations that accept specific data types as inputs and return a calculated output. They serve as the primary processing tools for manipulating variables within an expression.

## Global Syntax
All functions utilize a standardized call structure:
`functionName(argument1, argument2, ...)`

* **Identifier**: The specific name of the function, which is strictly case-sensitive.
* **Arguments**: The input operands enclosed in parentheses. Multiple arguments must be separated by commas.
* **Data Types**: Functions require specific data types (Numbers, Booleans, or Strings) for their arguments; providing an incompatible data type will result in an evaluation failure.

## Function Categories

Common mathematical functions include [abs()](./abs/), [sin()](./sin/), [cos()](./cos/), [clamp()](./clamp/), and many others available in the complete reference.
