# Control Practicals
#### Real-world applications and common logic patterns.
---

This section focuses on combining the elements of Funky Trees to solve common aircraft design challenges.

## Common Patterns
* **Toggle Switches**: Converting a momentary button press into a persistent "On/Off" state.
* **Speed-Sensitive Controls**: Automatically reducing control surface deflection at high speeds to prevent structural failure or pilot blackout.
* **Automated Systems**: Creating landing gear doors that open and close based on the `GearDown` state or automatic flaps that deploy based on `IAS` and `AltitudeAgl`.
