# Other FT Interfaces
#### Specialized ways to interact with the Funky Trees system.

Beyond standard part inputs and variable setters, FT can be utilized in other areas.

## Cockpit Instruments
Custom gauges and digital displays in the cockpit can use FT expressions to determine needle position, text display, or warning light activation.

## Label Formatting
The `Label` part can display dynamic text using FT. By using curly braces `{}` within the label text, you can embed expressions that display real-time data to the pilot.
