# Operators
#### The basic tools for mathematical and logical operations.
---

Operators allow you to combine variables and numbers into functional logic.

## Arithmetic Operators
The standard tools for mathematical calculations:
* `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division)
* `%` (Modulo/Remainder)
* `^` (Power/Exponent)

## Comparison Operators
Used to compare two values, resulting in a Boolean (true/false) output:
* `=` (Equal to)
* `!=` (Not equal to)
* `>`, `<` (Greater than, Less than)
* `>=`, `<=` (Greater than or equal to, Less than or equal to)

## Logical Operators
Used to combine multiple conditions:
* `&` or `&&` (And)
* `|` or `||` (Or)
* `!` (Not/Invert)

## Ternary Operator
The "if-then-else" shortcut: `Condition ? ValueIfTrue : ValueIfFalse`.
Example: `GearDown ? 1.0 : 0.0`
