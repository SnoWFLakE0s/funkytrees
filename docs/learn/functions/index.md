# Functions
#### Advanced mathematical tools and controllers.
---

Functions are pre-built commands that perform complex operations on an input.

## Basic Functions
Standard math tools like `abs()`, `sqrt()`, and `clamp()`.

## Trigonometry
Tools for calculating angles and vectors, such as `sin()`, `cos()`, and `atan2()`.

## Specialized Controllers
Powerful tools designed specifically for vehicle simulation:
* **Smooth**: Limits the rate of change of a signal.
* **PID**: A Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller for automated stability.
* **Rate/Sum**: Functionally the derivative and integral of a variable over time.
