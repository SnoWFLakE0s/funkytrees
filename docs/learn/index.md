# Learn Funky Trees

Funky Trees is an very interesting programming language built for SimplePlanes. Its structure lends itself well to the intended use case of real time control (RTC) and other automation processes for various devices within the SimplePlanes game, allowing for creating very powerful and effective control flows for your crafts. Funky Tree's simple and straightforward syntax along with its repeated-loop execution, make it ideal for sequencing, dynamic control, and automation with full support on all platforms.

This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Funky Trees language and system. It helps to have SimplePlanes open and ready for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read offline as well.

For a more detailed description of available features, refer to the Funky Trees Reference Documents. They contain the full documentation of all features, behaviors, and attributes of the language.

This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Funky Trees' most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the style of the language. However, after reading it, you should be able to read and write generic simple FT code, and most certainly poised to learn more.
