# Variables
#### An introduction to the data sources available to your aircraft.
---

Variables are the "inputs" for your expressions. They are categorized based on their source.

## Built-in Variables
These are provided by the game and represent the state of the world or the pilot's controls. They cannot be modified by the user.
* **Examples**: `Pitch`, `Altitude`, `GForce`, `TargetDistance`.

## Custom Variables
These are created by the user to perform specific tasks.
* **Variable Setters**: Global variables created in the designer menu.
* **Part Variables**: Specific data points from named parts (e.g., `MyEngine.RPM`).
